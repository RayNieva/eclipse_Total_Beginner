# eclipse_Total_Beginner
EXPERIMENTAL - Another study in code generation by pre-building generic Java classes from an online tutorial to be used later.
The concept here is to use the Total Beginner Tutorial to pre-build classes starting with the Person Class and adding attributes that go beyond 
the original simple teaching concept. 

Originally with name and maximumBooks as the two initial fields were added street address, city, state and zipcode. The thought is to remove
maximumBooks and add it to a subclass of Person.
